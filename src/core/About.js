                    We are bridging the gap between the farmers and the society
                    by providing a platform wherein farmers can contact the
                    end-customer directly. We are committed to work for
                    betterment of farmers and improve their economical condition
                    via 'GreenFarm'. Also, End-constumer will be able to cut
                    down his expenses by buying directly from farmers.
